# Baseline v2.0 Beta 1 Release Notes
## New Features
- `--blurscreen` is now able to be disabled via profile. If you set this `BlurScreen` key to false then the `--blurscreen` feature of SwiftDialog will not be used. 
	- You may wish to add `--ontop` and/or `--moveable` to the SwiftDialog Options for each window.
- The "Ok" button can now be enabled for the List View window. 
    - New boolean key `Button1Enabled`
    - If set to true the `--button1disabled` feature of SwiftDialog will not be used. 
	- Default behavior for this key is `false` which will disable SwiftDialog button 1 (same as in previous versions of Baseline.)
- New profile configuration key `ReinstallDialog`. Use this key to configure whether SwiftDialog will be reinstalled as the final step of Baseline.
	- SwiftDialog has a feature to change the icon of the app bundle by placing a png file at `/Library/Application Support/Dialog/Dialog.png`
	- This key is useful, because you can deliver this icon via a Baseline item and Baseline will reinstall SwiftDialog so that the icon is adopted for your app bundle.
	- SwiftDialog will be reinstalled with the same priority as the initial deployment (a custom pkg in the SwiftDialog directory, Installomator, or a direct download from Github which is programmed within Baseline.)
	- Configuration behavior:
		- If this key is omitted from the Baseline configuration file, then SwiftDialog will be reinstalled as the last Baseline item *if the custom png file exists.*
		- If this key is set to `false` then SwiftDialog will not be reinstalled, even if a custom icon is found. This is useful if you're running Baseline for circumstances aside from initial workstation deployment.
		- If this key is set to `true` then SwiftDialog will be reinstalled as the last Baseline item, regardless of any other circumstances


## Improvements and Fixes
- Consolidated temporary files into a single directory to simplified the cleanup process.
- Better handling if the configuration profile contains both `LogOut` and `Restart` keys.
	- If both values are set to `true` then `Restart` takes precedence.
