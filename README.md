An MDM agnostic zero touch or light touch solution for macOS. 

By leveraging SwiftDialog, Installomator, and original code, Baseline provides an automated way to install applications and run scripts. Configure the behavior of Baseline via a mobileconfig or plist file. Baseline will install packages, scripts, and Installomator labels as defined in the configuration file.

## Requirements
- macOS 11 or newer
- An installation PKG for the project. Either the provided PKG or your own.
- A configuration profile defining what Installomator labels, Packages, and/or Scripts you wish to run

## Thank you to the Mac Admins Community
This project wouldn’t be possible without the amazing hard work provided to the Mac Admins community. Bart Reardon, Søren Theilgaard, Armin Briegel, Adam Codega, Dan Snelson, Pico Mitchell, and all of the other amazing people maintaining and testing SwiftDialog, Installomator, and other community tools.
